Install all the things!

In order to start being productive programmers, we need to set up our environments.

1. [Git](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/installfest/blob/master/ssh-key-generation.md)
2. [IntelliJ](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/installfest/blob/master/IntelliJ%20and%20JDK.md): the Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) we'll be using for this course
3. [Slack](https://slack.com): the chat client we'll be using in this course
